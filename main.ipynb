    "In this program, the BB84 Protocol and Quantum Teleportation will be used to securely send an image between two locations. For a physical implementation, I would use polarized photons to complete the BB84 protocol. The Z basis would correspond with horizontal/vertical basis and X basis would correspond with the diagonal/anti-diagonal (+- 45 degrees) basis. 0 means horizontal or diagonal (depending on basis) and 1 means vertical or anti-diagonal (depending on basis). So, a fiber optic cable could be used to connect mentee and mentor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For improvements, the two-computer system for this problem could be solved via push and pull from GitHub (simple approach). Or, a web server could be deployed in order to share public variables between the two computers easily. One computer would represent mentee (Alice) and one would represent mentor (Bob).\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations: There are many limitations to using BB84. First of all, if Alice and Bob communicated 100 times, only 50 bits of the key could be created. This is because Bob has a 50/50 chance of getting the same basis as Alice. There is also general quantum error -- quantum hardware today does not act with 100% accuracy in theory. Many times, even if the same basis is selected, the wrong bit will be measured, which can mess up the entire encryption/decryption process. If quantum hardware were to perform exactly like theory states, this problem would be nonexistent -- but this is not the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: In regards to security, a eavesdropper (Eve) would have a very low chance of getting the entire key right. If the setup correlates exactly to theory, any error within the key is due to the presence of an Eve -- she measured and transmitted the wrong state when she intercepted Alice's qubit. In terms of probability, Eve will go undetected (3/4)^n times and will only get the entire key correct (1/2)^n times, where n is the number of bits intercepted. In this case, n was 17083, so the probability of Eve successfully getting the key is so low that it is negligible. Also, due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, measuring a qubit would collapse its state, so Eve could simply not look at the qubit and interpret the data inside it. So, she would have to measure the qubit, with the risk that she is using the wrong basis and also Eve would collapse the original state due to her measurement."

    "In the BB84 protocol, the sender will choose a random bit and random basis for a qubit that they want to send to the receiver. Usually, the sender is called Alice and the receiver is called Bob. Once Alice creates a qubit with state psi (|+>, |->, |0>, or |1>), she will use quantum teleportation to transport this state to Bob. Teleportation is achieved because Alice and Bob's qubits will be an entangled Bell pair. Then, Bob will measure his qubit in a random basis. Alice and Bob announce their bases publicly, and the measured bit will be kept if the bases are the same (different bases will lead to a 50% chance of getting the right bit measured)."
